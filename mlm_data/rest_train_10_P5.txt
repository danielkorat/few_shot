The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy. So, my review focuses on the Bagels.
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good. So, my review focuses on the food.
i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played. So, my review focuses on the songs.
