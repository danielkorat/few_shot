My	O
only	O
disappointment	B-OP
with	O

that	O
they	O

,	O
however	O
the	O
trade-off	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
achieve	O
a	O
longer	B-OP
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
(	O
of	O
about	O
2	O
more	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
back	O
for	O
an	O

same	O
thing	O
-	O
blue	O

which	O
required	O

remove	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

,	O
these	O
MacBooks	O
are	O
encased	O
in	O
a	O
soft	B-OP
rubber	B-ASP

so	O
you	O
will	O
never	O
know	O
about	O
the	O

until	O
you	O
buy	O
it	O

break	O

use	O
it	O

very	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
multi-touch	B-ASP

make	O

it	O

I	O

from	O

I	O
HATE	B-OP
this	O

on	O

I	O
was	O

how	O

I	O
can	O
barely	O

any	O

The	O
one	O
down	O
side	O

it	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
play	O

it	O
tends	O
to	O

I	O

This	O

insane	B-OP

If	O
a	O

,	O
its	O
really	O
easy	B-OP

force	B-ASP

It	O
does	O

that	O

It	O

when	O
it	O

it	O

I	O

on	O
it	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
VMWare	B-ASP

It	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
easier	B-OP
to	O
navigate	O
through	O
the	O

to	O
find	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O

The	O

too	O

do	O
simple	O

like	O
opening	B-ASP
my	I-ASP
Documents	I-ASP

I	O
bought	O
the	O

because	O
it	O

The	O

As	O
I	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
reason	O

which	O

This	O
is	O
something	O
i	O
would	O
deffinately	O
reccomend	O
to	O
someone	O

Its	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
another	O
thing	O
I	O
like	B-OP

that	O

That	O
is	O
my	O
only	O
complaint	O
!	O

The	O
salesman	O
talked	O
us	O
into	O
this	O
computer	O
away	O
from	O
another	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
at	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
problems	B-OP
with	O
software	B-ASP
problems	B-OP
and	O
just	O
not	O
happy	B-OP
with	O
it	O
.	O

That	O
system	B-ASP
is	O
fixed	B-OP
.	O

The	O
computer	O
itself	O
was	O
fast	B-OP
,	O
ran	B-ASP
smoothly	B-OP
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
smartest	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
was	O
take	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
compare	O
laptops	O
before	O
making	O
my	O
purchase	O

Like	B-OP
the	O
price	B-ASP
and	O
operation	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
brand	B-ASP
is	O
tarnished	B-OP
in	O
my	O
heart	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
likely	O
due	O
to	O
poor	B-OP
grounding	O
and	O
isolation	O
between	O
the	O
components	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
I	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
fixed	B-OP
with	O
a	O
ground	B-ASP
loop	I-ASP
isolator	I-ASP
,	O
but	O
I	O
still	O
expected	O
better	B-OP

this	O

It	O
's	O
because	O
when	O

that	O
you	O
will	O
not	O

any	O
value	B-ASP

that	O

the	O
price	B-ASP
will	O
stay	O
the	O

and	O
even	O
if	O
Apple	O
does	O
decides	O
to	O
change	O
mode	O
,	O
your	O
laptop	O
value	B-ASP
will	O
only	O
drop	O
10-20	O
%	O

unlike	O
PC	O

which	O
drop	O
more	O

That	O

everything	O

The	O

the	O

My	O
opinion	O
of	O
Sony	O
has	O
been	O
dropping	B-OP
as	O
fast	O
as	O
the	O
stock	O
market	O
,	O
given	O
their	O
horrible	B-OP
support	B-ASP

this	O

just	O

For	O
the	O

it	O

everything	O

It	O

Bottom	O

I	O

you	O
'd	O
be	O

you	O
invest	O

this	O

As	O
a	O
lifelong	O

,	O
I	O
was	O
extremely	O
pleased	B-OP
to	O
make	O
the	O

So	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
these	O

,	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
and	O
got	O
myself	O
an	O
Apple	O

I	O

great	B-OP

The	O

this	O
was	O

I	O
received	O
this	O

let	O
me	O
just	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
its	O
the	O
worst	B-OP

Very	O
annoying	B-OP

My	O
main	O
reason	O
to	O
convert	O
was	O
the	O
imovie	B-ASP
program	I-ASP

It	O
has	O
a	O
faster	B-OP

If	O

an	O

Laptops	O
are	O

why	O
not	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
better	B-OP
battery	B-ASP
?	O

I	O
will	O
never	O
complain	B-OP
about	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
since	O
I	O
believe	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
and	O
my	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
was	O
worth	B-OP
every	O
dollar	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
big	O
fan	O
of	O
the	O
Netbooks	O
but	O
this	O
one	O
was	O
very	O
well	B-OP
designed	B-ASP
.	O

It	O
may	O
take	O
a	O
little	O
getting	O
used	O
to	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
viruses	O
or	O
other	O
headaches	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
warranty	B-ASP
on	O
this	O
macbook	O

can	O
last	O
up	O

5	O
years	O

It	O

The	O

The	O
statement	O

I	O
should	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
tired	O

every	O

the	O
only	O
down	B-OP
fall	I-OP
is	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
no	B-OP
cd	B-ASP

i	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
cheap	B-OP
to	O

also	O
very	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
best	B-OP
yet	O

I	O
was	O
loving	B-OP
this	O
Netbook	O
because	O
it	O
had	O
an	O
amazing	B-OP
screen	B-ASP
and	O
display	B-ASP
and	O
was	O
small	B-OP
and	O
light	B-OP
,	O
but	O
after	O
1	O
week	O
it	O
stopped	B-OP
openning	O
web	O

for	O
me	O
(	O
even	O
after	O

then	O
eventually	O
it	O
just	O
started	O
giving	O
me	O
a	O
blue	O

and	O
crashing	B-OP

I	O
booted	O

I	O

So	O
I	O
got	O
another	O

I	O
love	B-OP

But	O
in	O

it	O
is	O
totally	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

I	O

But	O
I	O
do	O

a	O

Numerous	O
problems	B-OP
over	O
the	O
next	O
3	O

had	O
to	O
send	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
will	O
happen	O
to	O
any	O

released	O
and	O
I	O
need	O
to	O

for	O
the	O
next	O

have	O
all	O

This	O

I	O
loved	B-OP

This	O

a	O
nicely	B-OP

lots	B-OP

you	O

I	O
highly	B-OP

this	O

The	O

The	O

you	O

They	O
break	B-OP
down	I-OP
just	O
as	O

and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O
do	O

get	O

is	O
because	O
no	O

I	O
suggest	O
you	O

something	O

you	O

they	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
send	O
it	O
back	O

of	O

you	O
are	O
taking	O
a	O
chance	O
of	O
them	O
testing	O
it	O
out	O

and	O
they	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
on	O

then	O
you	O
are	O

I	O
was	O

informed	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

were	O
dirty	B-OP

So	O
glad	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
waste	O
money	O
on	O
a	O
less	O
than	O

Have	O
n't	O

It	O
's	O
so	O

the	O

that	O
this	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
best	B-OP
out	O
on	O
the	O

HOWEVER	O
I	O
chose	O
two	O
day	O
shipping	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
took	O
over	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
arrive	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
quite	O
a	O
bump	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
$	O
599	O
that	O
this	O
little	O
guy	O
sells	O
for	O
,	O
which	O
leaves	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
next	O

this	O
is	O
quite	O

and	O
can	O
easily	O
slip	O
through	O

My	O

is	O
so	O
light	B-OP
that	O
I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
me	O
anywhere	O

it	O
's	O
exactly	O
what	O

wanted	O

and	O
it	O
has	O
all	O
the	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
absolutely	O
anything	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
stylish	B-OP
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O

EVERYONE	O

Can	O
you	O
buy	O
any	O

that	O
matches	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
of	O
a	O

It	O
feels	O
cheap	B-OP
,	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
not	O
very	O
sensitive	B-OP

That	O
defeated	O
the	O
whole	O

of	O
a	O

Though	O
please	O
note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O
crashes	B-OP
,	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
isnt	O
superb	B-OP
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
navigate	B-ASP
even	O
for	O
a	O
novice	O

But	O
until	O
now	O
,	O
no	O

The	O

it	O

the	O

the	O

only	O
FOUR	O
