well	O
..	O

overall	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
slightly	O
better	B-OP
than	O
average	O
phone	B-ASP
.	O

both	O
the	O
samsung	O
and	O
the	O
sony	O
phones	O
offer	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
features	O
than	O
this	O
6610	O
.	O

personally	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
samsung	O
phones	O
better	O
because	O
i	O
found	O
myself	O
liking	O
the	O
flip	O
phones	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
.	O

i	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
chance	O
i	O
will	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
samsung	O
flip	O
camera	O
phone	O
next	O
year	O
.	O

if	O
t-mobile	O
does	O
not	O
offer	O
such	O
a	O
phone	O
most	O
likely	O
i	O
will	O
get	O
the	O
t610	O
.	O

they	O
are	O
all	O
free	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
new	O
account	O
anyway	O
,	O
but	O
stick	O
to	O
t-mobile	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
use	O
your	O
phone	O
overseas	O
because	O
t-mobile	O
actually	O
allows	O
you	O
to	O
unlock	O
your	O
simm	O
cards	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
simm	O
cards	O
cheap	O
from	O
other	O
nations	O
and	O
plug	O
into	O
your	O
phone	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
doing	O
some	O
international	O

the	O

was	O
the	O
2500	O

think	O
is	O
better	O
than	O
the	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O

is	O
too	O
small	B-OP

too	O
faded	B-OP

this	O

a	O
myriad	O

so	O
i	O
pop-in	O

the	O

you	O
are	O
not	O

rather	O
you	O

the	O

the	O

just	O
got	O
more	O

i	O
tried	O
to	O
take	O
a	O

simply	O

that	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

i	O
ended	O

then	O
using	O
the	O

i	O

the	O
lack	O
of	O

being	O

to	O
run	O
without	O
special	O

also	O
a	O
downer	O

becuase	O
it	O

it	O

honestly	O
,	O
i	O
love	B-OP
this	O
player	B-ASP

one	O
horrible	O
flaw	O
,	O
or	O
mayybe	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
.	O

once	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP
is	O
awesome	B-OP
,	O
the	O
batter	O
life	O
is	O
only	O
6-8	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
because	O
all	O
my	O
music	O
is	O
320	O
kbps	O
which	O
does	O
affect	O
the	O
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
.	O

ok	O
so	O
i	O
donno	O
about	O
what	O
other	O
people	O
said	O
,	O
how	O
the	O
player	O
breaks	O
and	O
stuff	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
headfone	O
jack	O
,	O
fortunately	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

however	O
,	O
my	O
hard	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
did	O
fail	B-OP
,	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
not	O
dropped	O
it	O
once	O
.	O

therefore	O
im	O
saying	O
im	O
returning	O
it	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
i	O
will	O
see	O
wat	O
happens	O
with	O
my	O
next	O
zen	O
xtra	O
(	O
same	O
replacement	O
)	O
.	O

if	O
that	O
one	O
fails	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
i	O
hope	O
if	O
it	O
does	O
,	O
let	O
it	O
happen	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
90	O
days	O
,	O
not	O
later	O
,	O
cuz	O
thats	O
the	O
warranty	O
.	O

if	O
it	O
does	O
,	O
ill	O
give	O
up	O
.	O

basically	O
wat	O
happened	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
hard	O
drive	O
failed	O
.	O

thats	O
it	O
.	O

i	O
cant	O
do	O
anything	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
send	O
back	O
.	O

the	O
only	O
good	O
thing	O
about	O
this	O
whole	O
process	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
im	O
getting	O
like	O
a	O
34	O
dollar	O
amount	O
back	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
difference	O
between	O
when	O
i	O
bought	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
.	O

basically	O
u	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
given	O
the	O
player	O
3	O
stars	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
1	O
.	O

you	O
know	O
why	O
?	O

because	O
other	O
people	O
that	O
complain	O
about	O
this	O
player	B-ASP
are	O
talking	O
bull	O
,	O
this	O
player	B-ASP
is	O
awesome	B-OP
,	O
it	O
just	O
breaks	B-ASP
fast	B-OP
,	O
which	O
is	O
horrible	B-OP
.	O

now	O
honestly	O
,	O
i	O
love	O
this	O
player	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
all	O
seriousness	O
,	O
i	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
it	O
to	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
breakdown	O
flaw.	O
and	O
i	O
honestly	O
would	O
not	O
recomment	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
ipod	O
,	O
that	O
crap	O
sucks	O
big	O
donkey	O
.....	O
never	O
mind	O
.	O

i	O
hope	O
my	O
next	O
player	O
doesnt	O
breakdown	O
.	O
.	O

honestly	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
players	O
without	O
any	O
flaws	O
were	O
the	O

this	O
is	O
all	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
say	O

what	O
a	O
junk	O

every	O
time	O
nomad	O
thinks	O
the	O
file	O
is	O
corrupt	O
the	O
os	O
freezes	B-ASP
.	O

the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
recover	O
is	O
to	O
plug	O
the	O
power	O
cord	O
and	O
go	O
into	O
recovery	O
mode	O

so	O
if	O
you	O

to	O

out	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
a	O

the	O
reviews	O
of	O
this	O

can	O
be	O
roughly	O
divided	O
into	O
two	O
groups	O
:	O
(	O
1	O
)	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
had	O
the	O

those	O
who	O

for	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
are	O
mostly	O
thrilled	O
with	O
it	O

the	O
price	O
is	O
way	O
below	O
an	O
ipod	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
nomad	O
is	O
only	O
sligtly	O
larger	O
than	O
an	O

the	O
sound	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
is	O
very	O
good	B-OP

the	O
controls	B-ASP
are	O
somewhat	O
harder	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
oddities	O
about	O
the	O
software	B-ASP
tagging	I-ASP
system	I-ASP
,	O
but	O
most	O
people	O
can	O
live	O
with	O
this	O
.	O

because	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
capacity	O
of	O
the	O
nomad	O
,	O
owners	O
can	O
load	O
hundreds	O
of	O
cds	O
on	O

it	O

for	O
most	O

the	O

the	O
one	O
other	O
thing	O
i	O
observed	O

back	O
a	O

90	O

this	O

that	O

when	O

you	O
will	O

yourself	O
very	O
disappointed	O

at	O
the	O

they	O
are	O
pretty	O

also	O
require	O
you	O
to	O

to	O

the	O

my	O

is	O
to	O
wait	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O

maybe	O

will	O
come	O

it	O
will	O

its	O

maybe	O
more	O
competitors	O
will	O
bring	O

maybe	O
the	O
answer	O
is	O
to	O
buy	O

whatever	O
